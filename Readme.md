# Video File Handling with Node.js

## Introduction

This project focuses on developing a Node.js application for handling large video files. The main objectives of the project are:

- **Download from Google Drive**: Develop a Node.js function to download a large video file from a specific Google Drive directory.

- **Chunked Upload**: Implement a chunked uploading mechanism to efficiently and reliably upload large video files to another Google Drive directory.

- **Progress Monitoring**: Create an endpoint to monitor the status of both the download and the chunked upload processes, providing visibility into the progress of each chunk.

The project aims to provide a robust solution for handling video files, ensuring smooth and efficient transfer between Google Drive directories while providing real-time progress updates to users.
